# Easy-Edits
The user-friendly variant of ![Fast-Edits](https://github.com/callisto-jovy/Easy-Edits). Please note that for now only Windows is supported. 

# Usage
To use the application you'll need to clone the repository and the required setup as dictated by ![JNIGen](https://github.com/dart-lang/jnigen). 
You'll then have to build the Easy-Edits Java backend, run JNIGen to download the required JARs after which you'll be able to compile the actual application.
**NOTE**: At some point I will upload a pre-made executable and/or installer for the application.
