# Easy-Edits
The user-friendly variant of ![Fast-Edits](https://github.com/callisto-jovy/Fast-Edits). This is an extension on top of Fast-Edits, so both applications are needed. After the editing process, this app allows to export the config which then may be imported into Fast-Edits.
# 
In the future, Fast-Edits will be bundled with this app and called through the JNI, a step which will seamlessly integrate Fast-Edits into this app, creating one single application - Easy-Edits
